get into mode

bend to it

I have another commitment

bump into

hop on

out and about

get your feet wet

dive right in

upscale

sketchy

wonky

niceties

cross-check

give credit where credit is due

Clinch the deal

What's the big deal

What's the deal

a side gig

a side hustle

deliver the goods

a handshake is my word

a joint effort

a botch job

a bang-up job

Micromanage

Belabor the point

a labor of love

a new lease of live

In the market for

On the market

priced out of the market

Cut out the middle man

get something for nothing out

Own it

above my pay grade

go according to plan

quick and dirty

knock out the task

get up and going

jump into any issues come up

a bit of a stretch

touch base

speculate

stay at the head of the curve

putting that out there

open format
