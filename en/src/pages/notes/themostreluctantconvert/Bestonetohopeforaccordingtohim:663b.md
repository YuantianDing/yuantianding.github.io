The phrase "workhouse" refers to an institution where those unable to support themselves were offered accommodation and employment. These establishments were primarily found in the United Kingdom and were used to provide poor relief from the 17th to the early 20th century. Workhouses were often associated with harsh conditions, and people generally wanted to avoid ending up in one because it was considered a last resort for the destitute.

Here are example sentences to illustrate different meanings or usages of the word:

1. **Historical Context**: 
    - "Charles Dickens vividly depicted the harsh realities of the workhouse in his novel 'Oliver Twist.'"
   
2. **Metaphorical Use**:
    - "The office became a workhouse as employees put in endless hours during the product launch."

3. **Modern, Informal Use**: 
    - "He jokingly referred to his cluttered garage as a workhouse where he crafts his DIY projects."

In the metaphorical sense, "workhouse" can describe any environment that demands arduous, often monotonous work, not necessarily related to poverty or historical contexts.
