The phrase "a streak of" is used here to describe a certain quality or trait in a person that is present to some extent, but not to such an extent that it defines them completely. In the given sentence, saying the father has "a streak of genius" implies that he occasionally shows signs of very high intelligence or brilliant ideas, even if he isn't consistently or entirely a genius in every aspect.

Here are other examples illustrating different meanings of "a streak of":

1. **A streak of independence**: 
   - "Even though she usually follows the crowd, she has a streak of independence that sometimes surprises her friends."

2. **A streak of stubbornness**: 
   - "His decisions are often influenced by others, but he has a streak of stubbornness that kicks in when he believes strongly in something."

3. **A streak of kindness**:
   - "Though he has a tough exterior, there's a streak of kindness in him that shows when someone needs help."

In each example, "a streak of" introduces a characteristic that is significantly present in a person but not necessarily their dominant trait.
