In the given sentence, "farthings" refers to a former British coin or monetary unit that was worth one-quarter of a penny. In this context, saying "cared not two farthings" is a way to emphasize indifference or a lack of care. Essentially, it's like saying that the person doesn't care at all. 

Here are example sentences to elaborate on different meanings of "farthings":

1. **Historical currency**: 
   - "Back in the day, a loaf of bread could be bought for just a few farthings."

2. **Metaphorical use for low value**:
   - "His opinion on the matter was worth not a farthing to anyone in the room."

3. **Literary or historical references**:
   - "In Charles Dickens' novels, farthings often appear as a representation of the financial struggles faced by the lower classes." 

These examples demonstrate both the literal meaning as a piece of currency and its figurative use to express something of little value or significance.
