The phrase "witless worm" in the given sentence is used as an insult. "Witless" means lacking intelligence or foolish, and "worm" can be used derogatorily to refer to someone considered to be of low status or contemptible. Together, the phrase "witless worm" implies someone who is both foolish and insignificant or contemptible.

The phrase can be broken down into two parts that have meanings on their own:

1. **Witless:**
   - Example: "He made a witless decision by investing all his money in a scam."
   - In this sentence, "witless" refers to a lack of good judgment or intelligence.

2. **Worm:**
   - Example: "He felt like a worm when he had to admit his mistake in front of everyone."
   - Here, "worm" is being used metaphorically to describe someone feeling low or humiliated.

The combined usage, as in "witless worm," suggests a more intensified criticism by combining both lack of intelligence and lowliness. 

Here are example sentences to illustrate the phrase, albeit in different contexts:

- "After his cunning scheme was revealed, the self-proclaimed genius looked every bit the witless worm he was accused of being."
- "Stop behaving like a witless worm and start taking responsibility for your actions."
- "Despite his bravado, he was treated like a witless worm by those who knew the truth about his failures." 

These examples show how the phrase can be used metaphorically to criticize someone's intelligence and character.
